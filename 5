I Hlangovuyo Balfour I'm passionate about learning and expanding my knowledge.I have strong problem solving skills and enjoying takling complex challenges.I am a quick learner and I can adapt to new technologies and frameworks.I have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer science which is a self taught.I have a strong work ethic and am willing to put in the time and effort to succeed.I'm a person who have a positive attitude and am always willing to learn from mistakes.When I was learning JavaScript , I found that I could often solve problems by breaking them down into smaller pieces.This approach helped me to understand the concepts better and write better code.At first, the idea or perform tasks seemed overwhelming.  However , I took the time to understand how APIs work and to experiment with thwm.Over time I gained a deep understanding of how to use APIs code to improve my code.
