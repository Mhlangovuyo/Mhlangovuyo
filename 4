Curiousity helped me a lot in building my experience in the web development industry. I have worked on several small projects for freinds and family, building simple websites using HTML , CSS and JavaScript. I can say I prefer JavaScript than python for my own reasons, sometimes python is limiting me of what I want to do.Firstly coding was a self taught to me so when I was starting web development I was using free template.I learn a lot from those free website template I ended up building my own website for my laundry business.I have never created an app before but I'm still working on that, but I've created a few websites using React and Node.js worked on few wordpress themes and plugins.I'm learning more about accessibility and how to make websites that are accessible to everyone.Here's a thing a thing you may laugh , I think It was last year I built a website and It was beautiful and functioning the only problem I was struggling to make the website live for people to have an access on It.That is where I started to learn about domain names.
