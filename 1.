I Hlangovuyo Balfour I was born in East london in 1998 on the 9th of November.I started my primary school when I was 3 years old in Zwelihle Primary School in Mdantsane,from 2003 to 2008 I was in Zwelihle Primary School.Then from 2009 to 2011 I was on my Secondary school which is Mfundo Secondary School.I remember when I was doing grade 6 I discoverd that I'm good in mathematics,my marks were good.From 2012 to 2016 I was in Mzohle High School where I passed my matric.In 2014 in school we were given a chance to choose which subject we will do,Then I choose mathematics and Science.When I was doing grade 10 I was the highest in mathematics for the whole year that's where I first got my award.In grade 11 and grade 12 my marks dropped to 60% but fortunately I passed my matric.In 2017 early january I lost my father I ended up taking gap year because in that University they wanted the registration fee from me.In 2018 I was registerd In WSU for diploma in eletrical engineering,I was new to that life everything was exciting I ended up failing.In 2019 I really wanted further for my studies then I registered in Unisa for diploma in mathematics and statistics, I was paying for my studies in unisa my mother ran out of money then I forced by circumstances to not be able to continue with the studies.In 2020 till 2022 I was doing my laundry business to raise money because I really wanted to go back to school.So this year I got a 3 months job contract in Cape Town so ended up coming to Cape Town because there was nothing for me in Eastern Cape.While I was on that job I was doing CompTia A+ certification for 3 months.I felt inlove with technology because there's an updrage on it each an everyday,That's where I found out about Umuzi not only Umuzi I found many bootcamps but I chose Umuzi for web develoment.
